# StripeWebDesignClone
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to observe the fine details of a major tech company's website in order to refine my front-end design skills. I took note of small things like how colour shading, drop-shadows and subtle animation transitions are used to create a polished look and feel. I feel as though it is easy to get stuck not knowing why your designs don't look very professional, and one way to combat this is to learn through observation.
### Technologies and techniques used:
- CSS gradients
- CSS grid
- HTML5 semantic markup
- Inline SVG
- CSS transformations
- Style a div to look like a tablet/phone
- Subtle drop-shadows, material design-esque look
